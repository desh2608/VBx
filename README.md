## Clustering-based Diarization

Python implementations of some clustering-based diarization systems.

### Features

* End-to-end recipes (from unsegmented audio to evaluation) for LibriCSS, AMI, AISHELL-4, and AliMeeting.
* Using [Lhotse](https://github.com/lhotse-speech/lhotse) for data preparation. 
* Using [Pyannote 2.0](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio/tree/develop) models for VAD and overlap detection.
* Scripts for fine-tuning Pyannote models on AMI, AISHELL-4, and AliMeeting (fine-tuned models also provided).
* VBx and x-vector extraction from [BUT](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/VBx)'s implementation.
* [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) implementation of overlap-aware spectral clustering.

### Installation

We recommend installation within a virtual environment (such as Conda) so that the
package versions are consistent. To create a new Conda environment:

```
> conda create -n diar python=3.8
> conda activate diar
```

Once the environment is activated, clone and install the package as:

```
> git clone https://github.com/desh2608/diarizer.git
> cd diarizer
> pip install -e . 
```

The run scripts additionally use some Kaldi utilities (such as queue.pl or parse_options.sh), 
since we submit multiple jobs (usually 1 job per audio file). You may need to modify these
if you are running in a different environment. Alternatively, if you have Kaldi somewhere, 
you can make a symbolic link to the utils folder as:

```
> KALDI_ROOT=/path/to/kaldi
> ln -s $KALDI_ROOT/egs/wsj/s5/utils .
```

**NOTE**: To run overlap-aware spectral clustering, please install scikit-learn from [my fork](https://github.com/desh2608/scikit-learn/releases/tag/v0.24.0-dev-overlap).

### Usage

End-to-end runnable recipes are provided in the `scripts` directory. The scripts must be
invoked from the root directory, for example: `scripts/ami/010_prepare_data.sh` .

Each recipe (LibriCSS, AMI, AISHELL-4) contains scripts broken down into stages such as:
data preparation, VAD, x-vector extraction, overlap detection, and clustering, numbered
in order as 010, 020, etc. These scripts are supposed to be run in order.

By default, the scripts submit commands through the `queue.pl` script (see `utils` folder). To change
this behaviour, please modify the `cmd.sh` file according to your job submission system.

### Results

* **Voice activity detection (VAD) using Pyannote**
